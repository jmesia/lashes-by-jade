        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Lash Extensions by Jade!</p>
        <p>Allow me to introduce you to your Lash Technician and share some personal info.</p>
        <p>My name is Jamil and I began my career as Lash technician about a year ago as a part time. 
            Im currently a part - time student at UCF - Downtown campus with mostly online courses. I have a full time job remotely as a Sales Agent and enjoy taking clients any time with appointments at least 2 days in advance. Im a proud full time mom to a 4 years old who keeps me the busiest with so much joy. Her middle name is Jade and thatâ€™s where the name comes from.</p>
        <p>My lash jobs are done at my home studio located 5 minutes from UCF main campus. I love to work on you and make your lashes look flawless for any occasion or for special seasons. 
            I look forward to serving you!</p>
